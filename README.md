# 2025 hands-on practical on accessing Logan data

This is a practical session where participants will perform themselves sequencing data analysis using SRA and Logan. The goal of the session is to get first-hand experience in accessing SRA data, knowing where Logan data is, downloading it, and searching it. We will also venture in more general considerations on genome assembly graphs, such as the ones provided with Logan.

This is a heavily guided introduction, with all the steps shown with screenshots. Please go slowly and take the time to read everything. The screenshots are accurate as of June 2025, but some interfaces may change over time. Feel free to ask questions during the session if something is unclear!
